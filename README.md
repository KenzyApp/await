### New feature
There's a semi-useful kanban board of the things I'd love to see in Await. If what you're looking to build is not there, it may be worth using our "discussions" feature, or even better, hop on Discord and let's chat!

**Board**: https://github.com/getawait/await/projects  
**Discussions**: https://github.com/getawait/await/discussions
